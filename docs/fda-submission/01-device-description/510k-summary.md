## 4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

ENDOCHAIN-VIDUYA-2025 is a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) that provides clinical decision support for the early detection and staging of endometriosis using a novel geometric entropy biomarker called LEI-V (Lesion Entropy Index - Viduya variant).

### 4.1 System Components

1. **OpenBCI EVG Acquisition Module** – 6-channel electroviscerography using ADS1299 ADC
2. **Regenerative Spark Lattice (RSL)** – Electrode placement protocol based on Viduya Legacy Glyph geometry
3. **LEI-V Computation Engine** – Symbolic mathematics using exact algebraic expressions
4. **AI Fusion Platform** – Multi-platform Bayesian inference (Med-Gemini, Aidoc, Tempus, Viz.ai, OpenEvidence)
5. **Clinical Dashboard** – Web-based interface for clinician review
6. **FHIR R5 Integration** – EHR interoperability layer

### 4.2 Intended Use

ENDOCHAIN-VIDUYA-2025 is intended for use by qualified healthcare professionals as a clinical decision support tool to aid in the detection and risk stratification of endometriosis in adult women (18-45 years) presenting with chronic pelvic pain. The device analyzes electroviscerographic signals from a 96-hour monitoring window (V-CAW) and computes the LEI-V biomarker.

**The device is NOT intended to replace clinical judgment or serve as the sole basis for diagnosis.**

### 4.3 Indications for Use

- Women aged 18-45 with chronic pelvic pain (≥6 months duration)
- Pre-operative risk stratification before laparoscopic evaluation
- Monitoring treatment response in patients with confirmed endometriosis
- Screening in primary care settings with gynecology referral pathway
