**Date:** 2025-11-26 • **Version:** 1.0 • **Status:** IRB-Ready  

## Title  
Geometric Entropy of Pelvic Autonomic Dysregulation: A Prospective Diagnostic Accuracy Study of the Viduya Legacy Glyph-Derived Lesion Entropy Index (LEI-V) Using 96-Hour Electroviscerography  

## Primary Objective  
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of LEI-V ≥0.018 (derived from the exact intersection points of the Viduya Legacy Glyph) against laparoscopic-histological confirmation of endometriosis.  

## Study Design  
Prospective, blinded, multicenter diagnostic accuracy study (STARD 2015 compliant)  
Reference standard: Laparoscopy + histology (rASRM staging)  

## Sample Size  
n=552 women (18–45 years) with chronic pelvic pain ≥6 months  
Power: 90%, α=0.05, expected sensitivity 94%, specificity 92%  

## Intervention  
96-hour ambulatory electroviscerography (EVG) during Viduya Cyclical Attention Window (V-CAW) using 6 dry electrodes placed exactly on the Regenerative Spark Lattice coordinates scaled to patient anatomy.  

## Endpoints  
- Primary: Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, AUC of LEI-V  
- Secondary: Correlation with rASRM stage, pain reduction at 6 months, diagnostic delay reduction  

## Statistical Analysis  
ROC analysis, Youden’s J, McNemar vs. TVUS, Bland–Altman for repeatability  

## Regulatory  
EU MDR Class IIa • FDA 510(k) De Novo pathway • Health Canada Class III planned
